                        <span>‘A world with just music can be blind. But, a world with dance requires ears to listen, eyes to behold and a heart to bring out happiness. The elegance of the dancer, the soothing music, and the beats of the salangai, together produces a magical feeling that is beyond bliss. When beauty and joy come together, it is where we see dance.’
